# Brazilbot
A discord bot that sends you to Brazil

Add it [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=893785085285924864&scope=bot&permissions=0)

By default there is no permission role set, meaning everyone has access to the bot, so I recomend to set that up first.

### Commands:
(default prefix is "*")
* \*help : You get it
* \*brazil @user : Send user to Brazil
* \*unbrazil @user : Remove user from Brazil
* \*prefix [prefix] : Change prefix
* \*permissionrole [role] : Change the role required to use the bot (leave blank for no requirement)
